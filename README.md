My personal notes for Linux and any certs that may be involved, such as the RHCSA. All notes are handwritten using my own experience of using Linux for over a decade, as wel las from from various sources found both online and in books. 

Where necessary I will give credit to the relevant authors of the information that I find. 

All notes are taken with Neovim, but I also use Obsidian for reading notes when I want them to look pretty.
