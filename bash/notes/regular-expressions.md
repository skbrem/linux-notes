## What are regular expressions

Regular expressions are symbolic notations used to identify patterns in text. 

## grep

One of the main tools around for working with regular expressions is grep. grep searches text files for texts that match a certain regular expression and then outputs the line containing a match to standard output.

For example:

`ls /usr/bin | grep zip`

This lists all of the files in /usr/bin that contain the substring "zip" in their names. 

The following is how `grep` accepts options and arguments, with *regex* being the regular expression:

`grep [option] regex <file>`

Common `grep` options:

| Option | Long | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | `--ignore-case` | Ignore uppercase and lowercase. |
| `-v` | `--invert-match` | Invert match. `grep` will usually print lines that contain a specified match. This option makes it so `grep` instead prints out every line that is not the specified match. |
| `-c` | `--count` | Prints the number of matches instead of the lines themselves. If using the `-v` option, it prints the number of non-matches. |
| `-l` | `--files-with-matches` | Prints the name of each file that contains a match instead of the lines themselves. |
| `-n` | `--line-number` | Prefix each of the matching lines with the number of the line in the file. |
| `-h` | `--no-file` | For multi-search, suppresses the output of the filenames. |
| `q` | `--quiet`, `--silent` | Suppress all of the output. Useful when creating scripts when we want to test if a match has been found. |

## Metacharacters and Literals

When searching for something simple like `bzip` using `grep`, the regular expression here is bzip, and `grep` will only match the same characters in the same order. This means that the line in the file will need to have four characters in the order b z i p, with no characters inbetween. The characters in the string bzip are **literal** characters in that they match themselves. Along with literal characters, regular expression can also include metacharacters, which can help for doing more complex matching. These characters include:

`^ $ . [ ] { } - ? * + ( ) | \`

Any character apart from these is considered literal. The backslash is sometimes used to create meta sequences as well as allowing metacharacters to be escaped and treated as literals.

> [!tip]
> Many metacharacters are the same characters that Bash will expand when used. This means that it's a good idea to enclose characters in quotes when using regular expression to stop the shell from trying to expand them.

### Any character

The dot or period character is used to match any character, matching any character where the dot is placed. 

`grep -h '.zip' dirlist*.txt`

It's interesting to note that adding the any character as a dot increases the regex size to 4 characters, meaning that names that are 3 characters in length will not be included in the result. Any files that have the file extension `.zip` will also have been matched. 

### Anchors

The dollar sign $ and the caret ^ are known as anchors. It means that the match only takes place if the regular expression is found at the end of the line $ or at the beginning of the line ^. 

```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ grep -h '^zip' dirlist*.txt
zip
zipcloak
zipgrep
zipinfo
zipnote
zipsplit
[me@linuxbox ~]$ grep -h 'zip$' dirlist*.txt
gunzip
gzip
funzip
gpg-zip
preunzip
prezip
unzip
zip
[me@linuxbox ~]$ grep -h '^zip$' dirlist*.txt
zip
```

> [!note]
> Using `^$` with nothing in between will match blank lines.

### Bracket Expansion and Character Classes

Bracket expansion allow us to specify a set of characters, which includes characters that would otherwise be metacharacters to be matched with.

`grep -h '[bg]zip' dirlist*.txt`

Will give us:

```bash
bzip2
bzip2recover
gzip
```

Metacharacters lose their meaning in brackets, and expect for two cases:

- The caret ^ indicates negation
- The dash - indicates a character range

#### Negation

If the caret ^ is found at the beginning of the bracket expansion, the other characters in the brackets are interpreted as characters that must not be included at the given character position. 

`grep -h '[^bg]zip' dirlist*.txt`

The ^ only works when at the front of the bracket expansion. If placed anywhere else, it acts as a regular literal character within the set.

#### Traditional Character Ranges

If we wanted to create a regex that found every file in our lists that began with an uppercase letter, the long and inefficient way to do it would be to use:

`grep -h '^[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]' dirlist*.txt`

Which is basically typing every uppercase letter into the brackets, and takes a lot of work. Fortunately there is an easier way to go about this:

`grep -h '^[A-B]' dirlist*.txt`

This is essentially abbreviating the range of 26 letters. There are a lot of ways of using this, for example:

`grep -h '^[A-Za-z0-9]' dirlist*.txt`

In order to include a dash - character in the bracket expansion, make it the first character in the brackets. 

`grep -h '[-AZ]' dirlist*.txt`

#### POSIX Character Classes

| Character Class | Description |
| --- | ---- |
| `[:alnum:]` | Alphanumeric characters, equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9]` in ASCII. |
| `[:word:]` | The same as `[:alnum:]`, but includes the underscore _ characters. |
| `[:alpha:]` | Alphabetic characters, equivalent to `[A-Za-z]`. |
| `[:blank:]` | Includes the tab and space characters. |
| `[:cntrl:]` | The ASCII control codes, which includes the ASCII characters 0 to 31 and 127. |
| `[:digit:]` | Numerals 0 to 9. |
| `[:graph:]` | Visible characters. Includes characters 33 to 126 in ASCII. |
| `[:lower:]` | Lowercase characters. |
| `[:punct:]` | The punctuation characters. The equivalent to [-!"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\\\]_`{|}~] |
| `[:print:]` | Printable characters. Includes all the characters in `[:graph:]` as well as the space characters. |
| `[:space:]` | Whitespace characters including space, tab, carriage return, newline, vertical tab, and form feed. Equivalent to: [ /t /r /n /v /f ] |
| `[:upper:]` | Uppercase characters. |
| `[:xdigit:]` | Characters that are used to express hexadecimal numbers, equivalent of: [0-9A-Fa-f]. |

This means that instead of using:

`ls /usr/sbin/[A-Z]*`

We can use:

`ls /usr/sbin/[[:upper:]]*`

Which provides the same result. 

#### POSIX Basic Expression vs. Extended Expression

POSIX splits regular expression implementations into two kinds:

- Basic regular expression (BRE)
- Extended regular expression (ERE)

In BRE, these metacharacters are recognised:

`^ $ . [ ] *`

All other characters are interpreted as literals. With ERE, on the other hand, the following characters are included:

`( ) { } ? + |`
