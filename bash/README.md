All of the notes and scripts that I am taking as I become more familiar with Bash and the commandline. This repo will be a mixture of my personal, handwritten notes as well as various scripts that I write as I become more proficient at Bash scripting. 

All notes and scripts are done with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
