## Variables

Variables are used to assign values to variable names. For example:

`name="steve"

```bash
echo ${name} => steve # This prints a variable value
echo $name => steve # This prints a variable value
echo "$name" => steve # This prints a variable blue
echo '$name' => $name # This prints the exact string
echo "${name}!" => name! # This concatenates the variable with '!'
```

> [!tip] 
> Remember not to add a space between the variable, the equals sign, and the value. 
> 
> `name = "steve"` will cause an error.
> 
> When assigning a value, don't use the $ sign. But the $ is used when referencing the value of a variable.
> - Assigning: `name="steve"`
> - Referencing: `echo $name`

## Comments

Comments are used to create notes about code and Bash will ignore them. To create a comment, use the `#` symbol.

`# This is a comment`

It's also possible to create multi-line commends in Bash using : ' to make a block.

```
: `
 a Multi-line comment made in bash
 
 Allows for adding info in blocks
`
```

Let's start with a simple Bash script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

greet="world World
echo "$greet!, I'm new here."
$ Hello world! I'm new here
```

Once a script is written, there are two ways of running it:

```bash
$ chmod +u helloworld.sh
$ chmod 744 helloworld.sh # The absolute way
$ ./helloworld.sh

# another way is
$ bash helloworld.sh
```

## Special Parameters

Special parameters are variables that provide info about arguments, the environment that the shell uses, as well as the state of execution of the script. 

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $1...$9 | Parameters 1 to 9 (positional arguments) |
| $0 | Name of script or shell | 
| $1 | The first argument that is passed on to the function or script |
| ${10} | This is is positional parameter 10 |
| $# | The total amount of positional parameters |
| $* | All positional parameters as single word |
| $@ | All parameters as separate words |
| $$ | The process ID of the current shell |
| $- | The current options for the shell |
| $_ | The last argument of previous command |
| $? | Exit status of the last command |

## Functions

Provides the ability to group code into blocks, and can be defined with or without a function keyword. 

```
#!/bin/bash

get_name() {
    echo "steve"
}

# Using a function keyword
function get_name() {
    echo "steve"
}

echo "You are $(get_name)
```


> [!tip]
> Functions are able to return values using `echo`, and the result can be used with command substitution.

## Conditions

Conditional statements allow you to make decisions. The `if` statement evaluates whether a condition is either true or false, ad then will execute the following portion of the code. 

```
#!/bin/bash

condition="test"

if [[ -z "$condition" ]]; then
    echo "Condition is empty"
elif [[ -n "$condition" ]]; then
    echo "Condition is not empty"

fi

```
